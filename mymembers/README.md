# MyMembers - Information made complete

Whenever you want to know when one of your members has joined your guild, when he created his account, get information about them, MyMembers is **__THE__** cog for that job!
It allows you to have a clear and extremely complete view about the members of your guild with the ability to drop you a JSON representation of one of your members, containing a shit ton of information about them
It takes all possible properties that a member can had as long as it's an interesting information and is not a problem for others users.
It is really useful for moderators/administrators when it comes to recognize one certain person.

## Advantages

- Get all infos about one members

## Disadvantage

- May not please everyone has it return *too much* information, and may represent a risk of data divulgating.
